                        <p>Archery is the art of shooting arrows from a bow at a target. The closer the shot is to the center of the target, the higher the score will be. The individual scores are added up, and the archer with the highest total wins the competition. There is Target Archery and Field Archery. Target archery involves shooting at one target from various distances.</p>
						
						<p>Bows are made of materials like Bamboo, carbon, fiber glass and have a sight and stabilizers. Stabilizers are attached to the bow to help keep it steady while shooting. Arrows have a sharp metal tip at the front and a groove at the back that slots over the bow string. The targets or butts are made of straw ropes that are stitched together. Colored paper or canvas targets are pinned to the targets.

                        <p>The history of Archery in India dates back to the Vedic Period. During this time, bows and arrows were used for the purposes of hunting and gathering food. It was of immense importance in ancient India and this is testified to by the fact that the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, two massive sagas of royal lineages, are filled with passages that describe the techniques of archery, and the attitudes and customs surrounding its practice. All the principal characters of these two epics were described as great warriors of archery. Both these texts make it very clear that archery was a king`s domain. Public demonstration of skill in archery was demanded of anyone who claimed the title of raja, or king, and there were many ways in which this skill was measured.</p> 
						<p>In the medieval period also, Archery was played quite extensively in India. Archery continued to be practiced in the Indian palaces up through the end of the nineteenth century. In modern times, Archery has already made its way to the Olympic Games, as well.

                        <p>Archery in India has a rather long history in India and is counted among one of the ancient sports of the country. Currently, the game is quite widespread and is seen gaining prominence as an important precision sport.</p>
                        <p>Archery is one among the prime ancient sports of India. Traditionally, it has been associated with warrior-ship and kingship and it was an important requirement expected in the battle field. Though, it was mainly used in hunting and combat in the ancient times, archery has become a precision sport in the modern times. Currently, the game is quite widespread and is seen gaining prominence as an important sport. Young talents like <strong>Jayant Talukdar, Tarundeep Rai</strong> and <strong>Rahul Banerjee</strong> are making waves at the big stage. With international laurels pouring thick and fast, India is emerging as an archery powerhouse.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps what is so appealing about archery is its easiness and accessibility to just about everyone. Almost every age group can participate and enjoy this sport. While it is a fun sport, it is also physically demanding. By playing archery, you are increasing not only strength but also focus, flexibility, and attention skills. It is relatively inexpensive if you just want to play for fun. If, however, you want to play for competition, then the price can jump quite high and take up a lot of your time.</p>
                        <p>Remember this; archery is not about winning or losing. The ultimate goal of an archer is to enjoy playing the game for what it is, not just for winning. The archer should focus more on improving himself than trying to beat other people. Once you realize this, then, archery becomes a lot more fun.</p>
